# Scarabée

Scarabée is simplified lattice physics code for light water reactor (LWR)
neutronics calculations. It currently has the following features:

* 1D Annular pin cell solver

This project closely follows the methods outlined in *Methods of Steady-State
Reactor Physics in Nuclear Design* by Stamm'ler and Abbate.
