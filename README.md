# Scarabée

Scarabée is simplified lattice physics code for light water reactor (LWR)
neutronics calculations. It currently has the following features:

* 1D Annular pin cell solver
* 2D Method of Characteristics solver

This project closely follows the methods outlined in *Methods of Steady-State
Reactor Physics in Nuclear Design* by Stamm'ler and Abbate, and *Lattice Physics Computations* by Knott and Yamamoto, from the *Handbook of Nuclear Engineering*,
edited by D. Cacuci.
